        "The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a powerful yet simple machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by identifying the closest data points (neighbors) to a new data point and basing its prediction on those neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "* It is extremely easy to both understand and to implement. There are only two parameters required, the value of $K$ and the distance function $(L1 / L2 / L^n)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- * It is non-parametric model, It does not assume any distribution about the data unlike linear regression. -->\n",
        "\n",
        "* It is lazy learning algorithm (no prior training  required). This makes the KNN algorithm much faster than other algorithms that require training e.g, SVM, linear regression, neural network, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "* It does not work well with large dataset, since the cost of calculating the distance between the new point and each of the existing ones is costly.\n",

        "In this section, we will explore and apply the various algorithms we've studied that are relevant for multi-output estimators, focusing on image completion. Our objective is to accurately predict the lower half of a face based on its upper half. We are using an example inspired by a case study available on the Scikit-learn website, which can be viewed [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/miscellaneous/plot_multioutput_face_completion.html). Through this exercise, we'll gain hands-on experience in applying these algorithms to a real-world problem, enhancing our understanding of their functionality and effectiveness in image processing tasks."
